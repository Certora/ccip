+/// @title UpgradeableBurnMintTokenPool
+/// @author Aave Labs
+/// @notice Upgradeable version of Chainlink's CCIP BurnMintTokenPool
+/// @dev Contract adaptations:
+/// - Implementation of Initializable to allow upgrades
+/// - Move of allowlist and router definition to initialization stage
+/// - Addition of authorized functions to to directly mint/burn liquidity, thereby increasing/reducing the facilitator's bucket level.
+/// - Modifications from inherited contract (see contract for more details):
+///    - UpgradeableTokenPool: Remove i_token decimal check in constructor
+///    - Add storage `__gap` for future upgrades.

-/// @notice This pool mints and burns a 3rd-party token.
 /// @dev Pool whitelisting mode is set in the constructor and cannot be modified later.
 /// It either accepts any address as originalSender, or only accepts whitelisted originalSender.
 /// The only way to change whitelisting mode is to deploy a new pool.
 /// If that is expected, please make sure the token's burner/minter roles are adjustable.
 /// @dev This contract is a variant of BurnMintTokenPool that uses `burn(amount)`.
